      <p>From PRX’s Radiotopia, Podquest is one of a series of new initiatives funded by a $1 million grant received in May 2015 from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Podquest is additionally supported by <a href="http://hindenburg.com/">Hindenburg Systems</a> and the media talent network <a href="http://airmedia.org/">AIRmedia.org</a>.</p>

      <h2>Podquest FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>What are you looking for?</dt>
        <dd>We’re looking for Radiotopia’s next podcast. We’re looking for creative, motivated, diverse producers, who will help take Radiotopia in new directions and attract new listeners. We’re looking for fresh ideas about compelling subjects that we can help grow into sustainable podcasts with increasing audiences and revenue over time.</dd>

        <dt>What are you not looking for?</dt>
        <dd>While we’re fans of many podcast formats out there, we’re not looking for: unstructured conversations, live storytelling, or ideas that overlap with shows already in Radiotopia.</dd>

        <dt id="diversity">What do you mean by diversity?</dt>
        <dd>Through Podquest we’re consciously seeking producers who range in background, experience, voice and style, and are especially interested in hearing from podcasts and producers not yet represented in Radiotopia. We encourage anyone who self-identifies as marginalized in the podcasting landscape – whether this is related to your race, ethnicity, religion, economic background, sexual orientation, physical abilities or other – to submit a show idea.</dd>

        <dt>I don’t have very much production experience. Should I bother entering?</dt>
        <dd>If you’re totally new to podcasting but have a stellar idea and the drive and motivation to bring it to life, we will consider your pitch. We recommend starting to get familiar with basic equipment and software the minute you finish reading this.</dd>

        <dt>I already produce a podcast. Can I submit that?</dt>
        <dd>Maybe. If your podcast is in its early stages or has been around for some time but you have clear ideas about continuing to evolve it, and your ideas are in line with Radiotopia's creative mission, go for it.</dd>

        <dt>Remind me of Radiotopia’s creative mission?</dt>
        <dd>To support motivated, independent producers and original, story-driven shows that champion creativity, narrative richness, and high production value. Also: keep reading.</dd>

        <dt>What do you mean by <em>story-driven</em>?</dt>
        <dd>Radiotopia shows explore storytelling across a range of styles, through compelling subjects, unforgettable characters and complex narratives. Radiotopians use the tools of the trade to tell these stories: interviews, scenes, research, recordings, writing, scoring, careful editing and sound design. Radiotopia shows inform, entertain, explore and provoke - all through the telling of exceptional stories.</dd>

        <dt>What do you mean when you say you’ll provide mentorship and podcast-relevant skill building?</dt>
        <dd>Depending on needs per finalist, PRX and Radiotopia producers will provide support in the form of editorial input, technical assistance, and workshops on marketing, promoting, budgeting, visual branding, and best social media practices in starting up a podcast. If needed, general oversight will be available throughout the pilot production season.</dd>

        <dt>Will you accept international submissions?</dt>
        <dd>Yes!</dd>

        <dt>Will you accept Non-English submissions?</dt>
        <dd>No! (Sorry, we don’t have the resources to support finalists working in languages other than English.)</dd>

        <dt>How many ideas can I submit?</dt>
        <dd>Entrants may submit one idea each. Send us your absolute best.</dd>

        <dt>What are you listening for in my audio clip?</dt>
        <dd>We’re looking for an original idea expressed clearly either through example or description. This can be an example of your work, or an audio introduction to you as a host. We’re open to exploring new forms; here’s your chance to get (and hold) our attention.</dd>

        <dt>Can I submit an idea in collaboration with someone else?</dt>
        <dd>Collaborations are welcome. Keep in mind that should your team be selected as a finalist, expenses will only be covered for one person to travel and participate in relevant activities.</dd>

        <dt>What's up with the 99 donors who are helping evaluate proposals?</dt>
        <dd>In last year's fundraising campaign, donors had the option of supporting us at a level to "help shape the future of Radiotopia," which is manifesting in their involvement in Podquest. Ninety-nine people raised their hands to do this, and will be contributing feedback about proposals, which will be considered in all final decisions made.</dd>

        <dt>Will my proposal be shared publicly?</dt>
        <dd>Maybe. We’ll be celebrating our ten semi-finalists online, including a sentence or two about their show ideas. If you’re further chosen as a finalist, we’ll bring you into public conversations about designing podcast strategies around initial show ideas.</dd>

        <dt>When and how will you announce the semi-finalists?</dt>
        <dd>By June 1, via the <a href="http://blog.prx.org">PRX blog</a> and at <a href="http://www.radiotopia.fm/podquest">radiotopia.fm/podquest</a>. You will be notified (gently) beforehand if your proposal is not chosen.</dd>

        <dt>When and how will you announce the finalists?</dt>
        <dd>At the <a href="http://podcastmovement.com/">Podcast Movement</a> conference in Chicago July 7 to 9.</dd>

        <dt>What happens if I'm a finalist but not invited to join Radiotopia?</dt>
        <dd>You own your idea 100% and are welcome to pursue your show on your own.</dd>
